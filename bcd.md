# BCD

Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) is a type of binary code that represents a decimal number in a binary form. It is a way of representing each of the decimal digits with a binary code.
The most common BCD code is the 8421 code. The 8421 code is also known as the 4-bit BCD code. The 8421 code is a weighted code, which means that each bit in the code has a weight associated with it. The weights associated with the bits in the 8421 code are 8, 4, 2, and 1. 
There are other BCD codes as well, such as the 2421 code and the 5421 code. The 2421 code is a weighted code, with weights of 2, 4, 2, and 1. The 5421 code is a weighted code, with weights of 5, 4, 2, and 1.

Excess-3 and Gray codes are also examples of BCD codes. These are non-weighted codes, which means that the weights associated with the bits in the code are not powers of 2.

We also have Parity and Hamming codes. Parity codes are used to detect errors in data transmission. Hamming codes are used to correct errors in data transmission.

## 8421 BCD Code

The 8421 BCD code is a weighted code, with weights of 8, 4, 2, and 1. To convert decimal numbers to 8421 BCD code, we need to convert every decimal digit to its 4-bit binary equivalent.
$$
(23)_{10} = (0010 0011)_{BCD} \\
(56.79)_{10} = (0101 0110.0111 1001)_{BCD}
$$
