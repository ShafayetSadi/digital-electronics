# Binary Codes

It is a way of representing letters, characters, and numbers using binary numbers of 1s and 0s. Some of the most common binary codes are:

1. **BCD (Binary Coded Decimal)**
2. **Gray Code**
3. **ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)**
4. **EBCDIC (Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code)**
5. **Unicode**
6. **Excess-3 Code**

## Classification of Binary Codes

* Weighted: BCD, 8421, 2421, 5211
* Non-weighted: Gray, Excess-3, Parity, Hamming
* Sequential: Gray, Johnson
* Alphanumeric: ASCII, EBCDIC, Unicode
* Cyclic: Gray, Johnson


## Difference between ASCII and Unicode

| ASCII | Unicode |
|-------|---------|
| ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. | Unicode is a universal character encoding standard. |
| ASCII uses 7 bits to represent a character. | Unicode uses 8, 16, or 32 bits to represent a character. |
| ASCII can represent 128 characters. | Unicode can represent 1,114,112 characters. |
| Uses fixed length encoding. | Uses variable length encoding. |
| ASCII is limited to English characters. | Unicode supports multiple languages and symbols. |
| Used in old legacy systems. | Used in modern systems and applications. |
| ASCII is not backward compatible with Unicode. | Unicode is backward compatible with ASCII. |
