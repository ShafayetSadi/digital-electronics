# Binary Codes

It is a way of representing letters, characters, and numbers using binary numbers of 1s and 0s. Some of the most common binary codes are:

1. **BCD (Binary Coded Decimal)**
2. **Gray Code**
3. **ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)**
4. **EBCDIC (Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code)**
5. **Unicode**
6. **Excess-3 Code**

## Classification of Binary Codes

* Weighted: BCD, 8421, 2421, 5211
* Non-weighted: Gray, Excess-3, Parity, Hamming
* Sequential: Gray, Johnson
* Alphanumeric: ASCII, EBCDIC, Unicode
* Cyclic: Gray, Johnson


## Difference between ASCII and Unicode

| **ASCII** | **Unicode** |
|-------|---------|
| ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. | Unicode is a universal character encoding standard. |
| ASCII uses 7 bits to represent a character. | Unicode uses 8, 16, or 32 bits to represent a character. |
| ASCII can represent 128 characters. | Unicode can represent 1,114,112 characters. |
| Uses fixed length encoding. | Uses variable length encoding. |
| ASCII is limited to English characters. | Unicode supports multiple languages and symbols. |
| Used in old legacy systems. | Used in modern systems and applications. |
| ASCII is not backward compatible with Unicode. | Unicode is backward compatible with ASCII. |


## Bytes, Nibbles and Words

* **Byte:** A group of 8 bits is called a byte. It is the basic unit of storage in a computer.
* **Nibble:** A group of 4 bits is called a nibble. It is half of a byte.
* **Word:** It depends on the computer architecture. In a 16-bit computer, a word is 16 bits. In a 32-bit computer, a word is 32 bits. In a 64-bit computer, a word is 64 bits.

## Why Binary Codes are Used?

Binary is transistor based, which is the fundamental building block of digital systems. It is easier to maintain saturation and cutoff regions in transistors, enabling devices to be in either ON or OFF state.
