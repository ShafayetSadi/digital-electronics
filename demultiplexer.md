# Demultiplexer

A demultiplexer is a combinational circuit that receives information from a single line and directs it to one of 2^n possible output lines. A demultiplexer of 2^n outputs has n select lines, whose binary value determines the particular output line to which the input is transmitted. We also have a enable input, which is used to enable the demultiplexer. If the enable input is 0, the demultiplexer will not work.
